            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up, I really loved to write down any random thoughts that passed through my mind.
                I remember the time when I got my first binder, where I used to write some imaginative stories, poems,
                and cringey day-to-day events that I had. Time flies, The internet came to my life and and slowly
                shifted from my beloved binder to blogger. I was in Juior High when I create my first blogger.com
                account to write some things about my favorite game at that time (i still have the website anw üòÅ).
            </p>
            <p>
                In high school, I once again shifted from blogger.com to tumblr as I found it easier to post directly
                from Instagram, plus the tumblr community was a thing back then. At this point in my life, I technically
                wrote everything via Instagram, posted it all at once to Tumblr, and deleted the Instagram post because I 
                didn't really want anyone to read my writings. Unfortunately, in 2016, Tumblr got banned in Indonesia. Therefore, 
                I stopped writing stories and thoughts. Althogh, the ban has been lifted, I lost access to my account and couldn't 
                even find it if I searched it.
