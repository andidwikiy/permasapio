                <p>
                    Growing up, I really loved to write down any random thoughts that passed through my mind.
                    I remember the time when I got my first binder, where I used to write some imaginative stories,
                    poems,
                    and cringey day-to-day events that I had. Time flies, The internet came to my life and and slowly
                    shifted from my beloved binder to blogger. I was in Juior High when I create my first blogger.com
                    account to write some things about my favorite game at that time (i still have the website anw üòÅ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school, I once again shifted from blogger.com to tumblr as I found it easier to post
                    directly
                    from Instagram, plus the tumblr community was a thing back then. At this point in my life, I
                    technically
                    wrote everything via Instagram, posted it all at once to Tumblr, and deleted the Instagram post
                    because I
                    didn't really want anyone to read my writings. Unfortunately, in 2016, Tumblr got banned in
                    Indonesia. Therefore, I stopped writing stories and thoughts. Althogh, the ban has been lifted, I lost access to my
                    account and couldn't even find it if I searched it.
                    <a href="https://andidwiki.tumblr.com/">https://andidwiki.tumblr.com/</a>.
                </p>  
                <p>
                    I'm glad that I gained the motivation to once again write down everything that I experienced. To write down my feelings,
                    emotions, journey, you name it!. is cheaper than therapy, ya know.
