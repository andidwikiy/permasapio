                <td align="Justify"> This book is my personal favorite. The first time i read this book, i wasn't really
                    excited because it didn't feel exciting. however, as the story progressed, i felt more engaged
                    because it conveys very important message especially for younger people like me to keep figting in
                    chasing my dreams.</td>
